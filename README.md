### Technologies
  * Bootstrap for grid column design and navigation bar.
  * jQuery for ..
  * CSS, HTML, JS.

### Method
I have used a mobile first design, starting with a simple layout and adding some possible complexity later. Though emphasis has been on the scripting inputs and the quizzes more then the design. The project will use a single responsive, interactive page.

### Report

The basic layout and function of the input words stage was done first. There was an issue with adapting the langage selector plugin for bootstrap to work inside a form. A solution was found by sending the value to the bootstrap dropdown item and to hidden form field when a selection is made via javascript.


### Notes
  * The [bootstrap languages plugin](https://github.com/usrz/bootstrap-languages) has been edited to display "Other language" rather then "Unknown language"
